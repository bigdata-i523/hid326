        The vast volumes of data collected across the clinical trials process
        offers pharma and biotech the opportunity to leverage the information in
        these big data sets for improved clinical trial design, patient recruitment,
        site selection, monitoring insights and overall decision making.

        Autonomous cars depend on information. They’re equipped with technology to gather and 
        communicate a vehicle’s position, speed, direction, and braking status. They also 
        recognize traffic signals, proximity to pedestrians, and hazardous objects on the road. 
        With voluminous data being computed in near real-time, self-driving cars can respond to 
        dangers afoot or notify the car owner of imminent mechanical issues.
