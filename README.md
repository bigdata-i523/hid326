    title: Bigdadta in Clinical Trails
    abstract: >
        The vast volumes of data collected across the clinical trials
        process offers pharma and biotech the opportunity to leverage
        the information in these big data sets for improved clinical trial design,
        patient recruitment, site selection, monitoring insights and
        overall decision making.

    title:  Big data on autonomous cars
    abstract: >
        Autonomous cars depend on information. They’re equipped with technology to gather and communicate 
        a vehicle’s position, speed, direction, and braking status. They also recognize traffic signals, proximity
        to pedestrians, and hazardous objects on the road. With voluminous data being computed in near real-time, 
        self-driving cars can respond to dangers afoot or notify the car owner of imminent mechanical issues.
