    title:  Big data on autonomous cars
    abstract: Autonomous cars depend on information. They’re equipped with technology to gather and communicate 
    a vehicle’s position, speed, direction, and braking status. They also recognize traffic signals, proximity
    to pedestrians, and hazardous objects on the road. With voluminous data being computed in near real-time, 
    self-driving cars can respond to dangers afoot or notify the car owner of imminent mechanical issues.
